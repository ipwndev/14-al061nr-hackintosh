HP Pavilion Laptop Hackintosh EFI (OpenCore - Intel Skylake)
MacAddress and Serial Number are random, please re-set before use.  This EFI mostly works(refer to the disclaimer), and I have been using this machine daily for about a month.  I replaced the 512g, 5400RPM drive with a 240g PNY SSD. 8GB in single channel memory results in a useable machine, adding a second stick of ram has a noticible decrease in battery life.

### Notes and Issues ###

[1] Audio at full volume is still quiet for output(roughly 50% of manjaro while at 100%).  Microphone works at normal volume.  Using airpods or wired headphones results in adequate volume levels.  The speakers are what have reduced maximum volume.   

[2] Battery Life is about 1.3 hours.  I recieved the laptop in a poor state. It was roughly 2 hours in Manjaro for comparision.  I believe the laptop wakes periodically, even when the lid is closed resulting in slightly worse battery life.  Pstates have been configured.  The machine only charges to ~74%.  Occasionally doesn't charge, battery indicator does not always reflect accurately.  These issues existed in Manjaro/Arch as well.  The powerprofile has been set to that of a macbook air level of preformance to take advantage of the TDP-down powerconsumption of the i3-6100u(7.5 Watts@800MHz instead of 15) on battery.    

[3] Bluetooth does not have an independent toggle for power.
